Let's make a plan-

Final Vision

Transportation:
    Plane
    Train
    Automobile

Destination:
    Des Moines
    Chicago
    Minneapolis
    St. Paul
    Omaha
    Kansas City

    To get it working, let's just do generic restaurants and entertainment for each.
    Finalized, let's give each destination 3+ Restaurants and 3+ entertainments specific to the destination

Itinerary will be returned for user approval
If yes, user will be thanked
If no, user will be asked which aspect of their trip they'd like to change

Vetoed choice will be removed from the pool, and a new itinerary will be presented.
Rinse and repeat.

QUESTION: Present choices one at a time? or "here's a list, what don't you like?"



Fine tuning if I get to it:
Delays in input
Characterization of the program ("Hmm, let me think..." etc.)
